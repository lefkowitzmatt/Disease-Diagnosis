    "This noteboook will cover a disease diagnosis classifcation algorithm for diagnosis assistance. The algorithm is based off of a data set that is more than a decade old and is therefore more of a proof of concept. The recommendation afterwards is for hospitals to pull together and create a proper open source dataset with disease sympotms so that various aplications can be applied, one of which is a online tool to help individuals with self diagnosis. Especially during a time when testing is short, the output of number of cases with COIVD-19 as a possible diagnosis could be collected, along with the users location, to give an approximation on possible cases. This could help in mitigating disease and also help provide proper resources to those who need it."

    "The dataset used is from columbia http://people.dbmi.columbia.edu/~friedma/Projects/DiseaseSymptomKB/index.html and was collected based on patient discharge summaries at New York Presbyterian Hospital from 2004. The total amount of patient discharge included in the dataet collection was 33,724. The dataset includes the disease, the symptoms, and the number of disseases ocurring. The dataset contains a total of 133 diseases and their associated symptoms. The dataset version imported into this project does not include number of disease occurances as it is not used in the classification algorithm. The original dataset had codes for identification such as UMLS:C0008031 that were removed in excel using text-to-columns as part of a data cleaning step."

    "Once that cleaned dataset was created, another dataset was made to simulate thousands of cases so machine learning can be applied. Working from the cleaned dataset (Diseases_data.csv), the disease column was then populated for each symptom in excel and an ID was generated by adding numbers consecutively starting with 1. A unique case number was then provided in the next column. The ID represented the Id and the case number represented a mock case with the symptoms and diagnoses. The initial 133 diseases and associated symptoms were then duplicated hundreds of times with symptoms randomly removed, with each duplicate disease set representing a different case. A total of 3570 mock cases were generated. A dataset (diseases.csv) was thereby created that had a mock sample of over 3500 cases where symptoms were classified with their ultimate diagnosis.  "
