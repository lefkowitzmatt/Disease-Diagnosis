# Disease-Diagnosis
This repository covers a model that can take a description of symptoms and output a preliminary disease diagnosis

The project was completed using a Jupyter Notebook based in Python 3.

Several libraries were used:
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, ntlk, and re. 

Functions were created to perform natural language processing to take a naturally described symtom synopsis and classify a diagnosis based off of the symptoms contained in the description.

Future steps will be to utilize AWS to deploy the model via a web application.
